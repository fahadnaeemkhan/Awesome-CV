               takes appropriate action defined e.g. notify SDN controller etc}
        \item {Helped dataplane team in various VPP related blockers. Also helped the team with the right tooling for the project.}
        \item {Worked with dataplane team on various POCs e.g. VPP as L2 bridge connecting two KVM VMs, service chaining in VPP using VPP graph node abstraction i.e. ACL -> NAT -> Routing,
               VPP and hugepages configuration for performance tuning}
        \item {Briefly worked on P4 programable SmartNIC by Pensando for the POC of IPSEC offload}
